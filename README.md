## 5 Different Features and Functionalities of My Site

### 1. Registration Section

On my site, If someone wants to register his account then it's possible because I have used this kind of functionality using Google Firebase. After successful registration, a sweet Alert will show that "Login successful".

### 2. Login Section:

After signing in he or she will be able to login his/her account perfectly. But need to ensure them their email and password are valid or correct.
If the email or password isn't correct then he/she can't enter their account and face an error message. A sweet alert will also show in this section after login.

### 3. Log Out Section:

After successfully login in, If someone wants to log out then it's easily possible like other sites because this kind of functionality is also included in my site.

### 4. Service Explore Section:

On the home page, the Service section exists for viewing the summary of services but if someone wants to explore more then it's possible. To do this need to click the explore button and then open a new page to explore.

### 5. Protect Routes:

If someone tries to explore **services** and wants to see **"Profile"** or **"Dashboard"** then it's not possible if they have no account on my site. Because I have hidden them using a protected route.
